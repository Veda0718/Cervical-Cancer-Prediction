# Prediction of diagnosis of Cervical Cancer using ML

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the risk of cervical cancer based on demographic information, habits, and medical records. By building a robust model, we aim to:

 - **Improve early detection:** Timely identification of at-risk individuals can lead to prompt intervention and better outcomes.
 - **Enhance healthcare efficiency:** Machine learning can assist healthcare professionals in prioritizing care and resources, particularly in under-resourced settings.
 - **Develop a user-friendly tool:** A practical interface will make the model accessible to healthcare providers, empowering them to make informed decisions.

## Key findings:
 - **XG Boost emerged as the optimal model:** After evaluating various algorithms, XG Boost demonstrated superior accuracy and interpretability in predicting cervical cancer risk.
 - **Promising results for early detection:** The model holds the potential to contribute to earlier identification of at-risk individuals, paving the way for timely interventions.
 - **Future scope for personalized healthcare:** Integration with Electronic Health Records can enable personalized risk assessment and tailored preventive measures.

## Impact and applications:
 - **Clinical decision support:** Assisting healthcare professionals in optimizing patient care pathways.
 - **Public health campaigns:** Informing targeted awareness programs and resource allocation for screenings.
 - **Research and drug development:** Providing insights for identifying potential drug targets and treatment strategies.

## Next steps:
 - Develop a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into healthcare workflows.
 - Continuously improve the model with larger and more diverse datasets.
 - Explore the inclusion of additional features, such as genetic data, for enhanced accuracy.

This project demonstrates the promising potential of machine learning in aiding the fight against cervical cancer. By promoting early detection and informed decision-making, we hope to contribute to improved healthcare outcomes for women across the globe.
