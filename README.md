# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction

# Problem Statement
This project aims to predict the risk of cervical cancer in individuals based on demographic information, habits, and historic medical records. The goal is to build a predictive model utilizing multiple classification models. The dataset includes features such as age, number of sexual partners, pregnancy history, smoking habits, STD records, and other demographic details. The objective is to create a robust predictive model that can identify potential indicators or risks associated with cervical cancer.

# About this dataset
The cervical cancer dataset contains indicators and risk factors for predicting whether a woman will get cervical cancer. The features include demographic data (such as age), lifestyle, and medical history. The data can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository and is described by Fernandes, Cardoso, and Fernandes (2017).
